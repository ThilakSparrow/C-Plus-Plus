# Circular Linked List Program Outputs

1. **Create:**
   - When choosing "1. Create," it will prompt you to enter data.
   - The first node will be created, and the count will be incremented by 1.
   - Output: "ENTER DATA:" (user input)

2. **Insert First:**
   - When choosing "2. Insert First," it will prompt you to enter data for the new node.
   - A new node will be inserted at the beginning of the list, and the count will be updated.
   - Output: "ENTER DATA FOR 1ST NODE" (user input), "ELEMENT SUCCESSFULLY ADDED"

3. **Insert Last:**
   - When choosing "3. Insert Last," it will prompt you to enter data for the new node.
   - A new node will be inserted at the end of the list, and the count will be updated.
   - Output: "ENTER DATA FOR LAST NODE" (user input), "ELEMENT SUCCESSFULLY ADDED"

4. **Insert After:**
   - When choosing "4. Insert After," it will prompt you to enter the position where you want to insert a new node.
   - Then, it will prompt you to enter data for the new node.
   - A new node will be inserted after the specified position, and the count will be updated.
   - Output: "ELEMENT ANY ADDRESS BETWEEN 1 and [cnt]" (user input), "ENTER DATA FOR NODE" (user input), "ELEMENT SUCCESSFULLY ADDED"

5. **Delete First:**
   - When choosing "5. Delete First," the first node will be deleted, and the count will be decremented by 1.
   - Output: "ELEMENT SUCCESSFULLY DELETED"

6. **Delete Last:**
   - When choosing "6. Delete Last," the last node will be deleted, and the count will be decremented by 1.
   - Output: "ELEMENT SUCCESSFULLY DELETED"

7. **Delete After:**
   - When choosing "7. Delete After," it will prompt you to enter the position after which you want to delete a node.
   - The node after the specified position will be deleted, and the count will be updated.
   - Output: "ENTER ANY ADDRESS BETWEEN 1 and [cnt]" (user input), "ELEMENT SUCCESSFULLY DELETED"

8. **Display:**
   - When choosing "8. Display," the program will display the data in all nodes and the total number of nodes.
   - Output: List of data in nodes, "Total no.of Nodes Present in a list: [cnt]"

9. **Exit:**
   - When choosing "9. Exit," the program will exit.

These are the expected outputs for the different switch cases in the circular linked list program.
